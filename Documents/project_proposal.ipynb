    "# Handedness and Tennis Success \n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "It was hypothesized that left handed tennis players have better developed tennis skills than those of right handed players (Holtzen, 2000). It is argued that left handed players can serve more strategically to their opponent given the developed spatial, motor and attentional functions (Holtzen, 2000). Given the hypothesis in Holtzen’s study that left handed players are better than right handed players at tennis, we want to examine if there is an association between handedness and tennis success. The data set we will use is Player Stats for Top 500 Players from Ultimate Tennis Statistics (https://www.ultimatetennisstatistics.com). The data set includes the player’s name, age, where they're from, handedness, source of information, current ranking, best ranking, their backhand position, net prize money, height, weight, coach, preferred surface to play on, information on the duration and dates of their career, social media, and personal game stats. Given our question on whether handedness and specifically, left-handedness, has an impact on success in tennis, we will designate handedness as the classifier variable and will designate best rank, prize money, best elo rank, peak elo rating, titles, and GOAT rank as the predictor variables. We chose these predictor variables as they all relate to the success of a tennis player's career. We omitted other variables like the player's personal info (name, age, height, weight, where they're from), social media and information source, coach, nicknames, backhand position, preferred surface to play on, and information on the duration and dates of their career as they were not relevant to the question we are answering in this project. From the remaining variables regarding the player's game stats, we omitted masters, grand slams, Davis cups, team cups, Olympics, weeks at No. 1, and tour finals as there was very limited data for these variables and we felt that including them in our data analysis would require a significant reduction in the sample size of the data set. We also decided to omit current rank, and current elo rating as some of the players may be retired and ranking decreases when a player is not longer playing, therefore misrepresenting the performance of the player when they were active.\n",

Next, we will use the resample function on the left-handed observations to increase the number of observations to match the right-handed observations by setting the n_samples argument to equal number of right-handed observations.
